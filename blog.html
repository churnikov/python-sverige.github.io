                        The disruption in the event industry this year did also hit our organizing team at <a href="www.pycon.se" target="_blank">PyCon Sweden 2020</a> .
                        Last year we arranged our biggest conference until then. A two day conference with 3 keynotes, 17 talks,
                        4 workshops and 2 panel discussions at a venue in the heart of Stockholm. For 2020 we had similar plans
                        and then in March everything changed. Since the conference is usually planned for the fall, we had some
                        buffer to decide if we even want to consider an on-site conference. We quickly decided against it and to
                        go fully online instead. This didn't reduce the planning and we had new points to consider opening our registration
                        up to the world.<br>
                        With a lot of energy and will we extended
                        <a href="www.pycon.se" target="_blank">PyCon Sweden 2020</a> and arranged a 2 day conference with multiple tracks,
                        4 keynotes, 35 talks, 4 workshops and 2 panel discussions!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Here is a checklist of things we had to do to arrange a conference of this format.
                        One can invest more time in many of those points, like extended marketing, a remarkable state of the art webpage,
                        intense participant & sponsor engagement and high entertainment in general.<br>
                    </p>
                        <p>
                        This checklist is not fully complete. Still it should allow you to arrange a conference with the main points covered.

                        Of course there are many more things that one could do during preparation time or the conference.
                        And if there is not a lack of anything it is ideas.
                        However keep in mind, that the time and energy you can spend on an event like this is
                        highly dependent on the amount and availability of voluntarily work.<br>
                        Since we want to keep our heads cool during the conference itself it is wise to prioritise and strike certain
                        points out in order to give others enough attention. If things go terribly wrong and we are already at maximum
                        capacity it could mean a total meltdown for some of us and would destroy our team dynamic drastically.
                        <br>
                        At PyCon Sweden we were incredibly lucky that we found committed volunteers that took full ownership to ensure a
                        great experience both for the speakers and the audience. And I am thankful for each single contribution!
                        <br>
                        There are always some hick-ups here and there, especially with technic involved it usually doesn't get easier.
                        A muted microphone, multiple posts with the same content, loss of connection up to a surrendering computer.<br>
                        But honestly isn't exactly that the delightful and exciting part of a live conference?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We hope you found the checklist usable and wish you good luck for your online event or conference!<br>

                            thoughts about Tech as a tool to improve diversity
                            and insights into the London Tech scene and culture.

                            <b>Christine: What made you start initiatives like <a href="https://www.emmstech.se">EMMSTechnology</a>

                        <p>
                            <b>Samira:</b> started these initiatives because the services we provide are things
                            I wish I had access to when I was trying to enter the Tech and Communication industries.
                            My main goal is to make it easier for other people to access certain opportunities
                            that aren't available for everyone. <br>
                            As a Black woman, I often found myself in rooms where I was the only Black woman.
                            I wanted to create spaces
                            where I could see other people like me, and where they could see me too and see that
                            they weren't alone. Representation is one of the most important things.

                        <p>
                            <b>Samira:</b>
                            I think Tech can be a great catalyst for diversity and inclusion, Tech can be so accessible
                            and democratise so much in the world. However, Tech really is only a tool and it's up to
                            the people using the tools, such as programmers, developers, and even business people to
                            make sure that the tool is being used fairly and ethically. When the code, text, and work
                            that we as people do can change the lives of hundreds of people, it's important that we in
                            businesses and teams actually start looking at our values and the change we want to be a
                            part of.
                         </p>

                            <b>Christine: You have recently moved to London, have you noticed particular differences
                                between the Stockholm and London startup or Tech scene?</b>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Samira:</b>The main difference I have noticed is cultural. I personally feel like London
                            has a 'hustler' kind of mentally where everybody constantly is working on something on the
                            side, or just constantly trying to elevate and become better in their work. Swedish people
                            have a sense of this as well, but we need to become more open and almost brag a little
                            bit more about the working that we're doing and not be afraid of constantly raising the
                            bar, taking the next step, and challenging the norms around us.

                        <p>
                            <b>Samira:</b>
                            My typical day usually starts with me doing my '9 to 5' job as a programmes manager.
                            I usually answer emails and do minor easier tasks in the morning. In the afternoons
                            I like to dive into more complicated and concentrated work, like writing reports,
                            planning programmes, workshops and other sessions. After that I'll do something more
                            personal like cook dinner, work out, or watch a movie to break up my day. Then I'll
                            do my work as a social entrepreneur. We're a very small team at EMMSTech so everybody
                            has to do a little bit of everything. I plan events and activities for our community,
                            liaise with our advisory board, work on content, and so much more.

                            <b>Christine:How do you see the demand of engineers in startups in the future?
                                And which skills would be good to have?</b>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Samira:</b>There's proven data that there is a lack of people with the tech skills that
                            the world needs in order to keep up with the change that is happening. I feel most
                            traditional institutions are a bit behind on equipping our generation with that skill,
                            while online schools and more modern alternatives are staying on top of the digital
                            curve. Traditional schooling needs to get ahead of that. Most importantly I think
                            there's a lot of soft skills that are lacking in our education. Instead of being afraid
                            of young children using computers and cellphones, we should embrace it and introduce it
                            in a responsible manner. Actually teach them about the internet and digital, talk to
                            them about the values that they should form and teach them to be sensible, ethical human
                            beings.

                            The first line I can recall was back in 2013 for a project named
                            PlexConnect, which at the time was one of the very few methods to play your private
                            media on the Apple TV 2/3. The project was very fresh, about two months old and
                            just three former committers. I wanted to help with debugging a few timing issues
                            in the application. And to do that efficiently, I needed to add timestamps to the
                            debugger logs

                            I've listed five recommendations for people thinking about starting their own business.
                            <ol>
                              <li>Find your first customers before you make the jump, which might take more
                                  time than you think.
                              </li>
                              <li>Don't be too picky before you've built up some financial buffer.
                                  Consulting is a great way to generate some positive cash flow,
                                  even if your dream is to build the next great product.
                              </li>
                              <li>Make sure that you save up so you can handle at least half a year
                                  without a salary. Even with a contracting gig day one, you still need
                                  to work a month before billing, and commonplace with 30 days more before
                                  payment is due, and I've seen as high as 60 days. Combined with this,
                                  in the best case, you'll be able to pay a salary month 3 or 4 of working
                                  full time in your business.
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                  Stay lean, keep expenses low in the start, you might desire to buy the
                                  beefiest workstation when the first check clears. But you never know when
                                  a global pandemic will hit with customers withdraw all ongoing contracts,
                                  having some extra headroom has saved me from tons of worry and grief.
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                  Use your network, the people you've worked with knows who you are and
                                  what you can do. But don't steal customers from your existing employer.

                            There's a thriving and growing tech-scene in Gothenburg, an accomplished
                            technical university like Chalmers attracts the talent that builds tomorrows
                            tech. We've got a mix of everything from bleeding-edge startups to established
                            industry giants like Ericsson, Volvo and SKF.
                            <br>
                            On the event side, one of my favourite events is the fantastic

                            conference where I've also spoken about Python. Johan Thelin does a marvellous
                            job every year with organizing it, and I'd highly recommend people to come and

                            event about every other month. It is a great way to hang out with the local
                            Python community and a perfect place to get some experience with talking about
                            Python in front of a slightly smaller crowd. It's great fun to see what other
                            Pythonistas are doing around town.

                            like drowning in a sea of C# in particular.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Ákos:</b> I started using Python at my first job around 10 years ago. Back then
                            I was working as a consultant transforming and moving data from systems to systems
                            for big companies. I was fairly new to the industry and my competence was in Java
                            (don't ask why) and the language didn't really help me write understandable transforms
                            and code with complicated business rules. Around this time I had a class called
                            "Scripting languages" at Uni which introduced me to the world of Python (and Ruby,
                            but let's leave that for now where it is), and I couldn't go back since. I started
                            writing most of my code in Python and afterwards nailed a full-time job with it. I
                            have been in love ever since.

                        <p>
                            <b>Ákos:</b> Berlin is a hot spot right now for software development. The youngness of the
                            unification of the two Germanies created a very buzzing and exciting vibe for young
                            talent to come here and work in the historical streets and neighbourhoods where new
                            meets old. Germany is a very open space for people from both outside and inside the
                            EU to work here, helping many from around the world to bring their work ethic and
                            knowledge and mix these together to learn and create something new and cool.<br>
                            The Python community is strong in the city as well! The Python User Group (PUB)
                            has regular events where Pythonistas are sharing their knowledge.
                         </p>

                            <b>Christine: What would you suggest a newbie in Python or in particular web development to
                                learn/read/try out?</b>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Ákos:</b> Great question! My brother started studying software engineering in the past
                            year and he was struggling with the basics of algorithm development because of the unnatural
                            syntax and fine-controlled nature of the C language. Since then he picked up Python and he
                            became a better programmer with more solid algorithms knowledge and more confidence in
                            touching more difficult languages. I got him a book called
                            <a href="https://automatetheboringstuff.com/" target="_blank">
                            "Automate the Boring Stuff" </a> with
                            Python by Al Sweigart to give him more inspiration on what code is capable of doing.
                            Regarding web-development in general, my wife started looking into
                            <a href="https://freecodecamp.org" target="_blank">freecodecamp.org</a> recently
                            and she likes it a lot. Hard to beat free. :)

                            for microservices?</b>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Ákos:</b> I believe that the biggest advantage of microservices is the separation of concern.
                            Building a monolith for your pet-project or at your early stage company is the way to go
                            business-wise. It will let you move fast, experiment more and ultimately grow in difficult
                            times. But just like putting too many things into a room and not being able to move around,
                            monolithic applications also get cluttered and even with the best intent of organization,
                            you will need to move a couple of things to different rooms. With separation of concern,
                            you can help your teams focus on the things that they are good at and have them not worry
                            about stepping on other people's toes. Bear in mind, all of this comes at a cost of
                            communication both on the network and the team level.
