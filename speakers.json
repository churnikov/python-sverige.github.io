        "abstract": "Anocca has developed a set of novel biotechnologies for deciphering and harnessing the human adaptive immune system to treat cancers. To support our biotech, we have created an information management system and a suite of automated data processing pipelines. The backend is built with Django, Celery, PostgreSQL and a GraphQL API. At Anocca we have a \u201csmarter-not-harder\u201d approach to our development process. We will present the use of the __init_subclass__\u200b and type\u200b special methods to automate schema and class generation, reducing boilerplate and repetitive code in our codebase.",

        "abstract": "In this session, we'll walk through a complete end-to-end example of using Hugging Face Transformers, involving both our open-source libraries and some of our commercial products. Starting from a dataset containing real-life product reviews from Amazon.com, we'll train and deploy a text classification model predicting the star rating for similar reviews. Along the way, you'll learn how to:- Explore models and datasets on the Hugging Face Hub, - Load, prepare and save datasets with the Hugging Face datasets library, - Load, train and save models with the Hugging Face transformers library, - Build ML applications with Hugging Spaces to showcase your models, - Use hardware acceleration with the Hugging Face Optimum library to optimize training and prediction times, - and maybe a few more things, if we have time! Of course, all code will be shared with you, and you'll be able to use it easily in your own projects.",
        "bio": "Julien Simon is currently Chief Evangelist at Hugging Face. He\u2019s recently spent 6 years at Amazon Web Services where he was the Global Technical Evangelist for AI & Machine Learning. Prior to joining AWS, Julien served for 10 years as CTO/VP Engineering in large-scale startups.",
