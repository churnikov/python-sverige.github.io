			<b>Abstract: </b>In oil & gas industry, data produced in a well costs substantial
			expenditure and thus must be used effectively. In this case, the
			machine learning algorithm by Scikit-learn is used to generate a
			model to predict borehole stability using drilling data to guarantee
			a safe pulling out of hole operation.

			<b>About the speaker: </b>Bertha Amelia, who currently lives in Stavanger (Norway), works as an
			operation engineer in National Oilwell Varco. Her background is applied
			geology. When she doesn’t work offshore, she spends her time running
			analysis of client’s wells data, mostly using pandas and scikit-learn
			to help extract quantitative information that can aid client to make
			important operational decision.
			She likes experimenting data with different python library since
			it provides flexibility and the fact it has a huge open-source
			community that always eager to help giving a solution.
