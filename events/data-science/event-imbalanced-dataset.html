			<b>Abstract: </b>Imbalanced classes is surprisingly common problem in machine learning.
			However, many machine learning algorithms do not work very well with it and
			can give wrong sense of good performance because of high accuracy score.
			we will get familiar with class imbalance and then see various techniques
			to handle imbalanced classes.
