			<b>Abstract: </b>To enable data-driven decision making, H&M is betting big on
			machine learning algorithms. As these algorithms proven extremely
			successful, our use cases needed to scale rapidly from few countries
			to almost every country where H&M operates. With that, we needed to
			rethink how we orchestrate machine learning pipelines to train and
			serve a large number of new models in production on a regular basis.
			In this talk, we share how we designed,  implemented, and operationalized
			a cloud-native scalable architecture for machine learning algorithms
			using Apache Airflow and Azure Kubernetes Service.

			<b>About the speaker: </b>Misbah Uddin is a machine learning engineer and a competence lead at H&M.
			When he is not working on next generation MLOps platform for H&M, he is
			helping H&M to recruit, grow, sponsor, and mentor top engineers and
			data experts.
			<br> Prior to working in H&M, he has worked as a software
			engineer focusing on search engines in different industries.
			Before that, he was an academic researcher and earned a Phd in
			telecommunications from KTH The Royal Institute of Technology.
