			<b>Abstract: </b>With ML being the new shiny object, No one really talks about the data pipelines
			that make the data consumable.<br>
			Single streamlined data pipeline may sound cozy but no one want’s to sit through 10 hours for
			ingesting 2 million records, do you? Trust me you don’t.<br>
			The solution? Distributed data pipelines.
