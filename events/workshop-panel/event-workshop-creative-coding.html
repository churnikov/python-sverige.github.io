			<b>Abstract: </b>Through the lens of the work we’re doing at imagiLabs, I will present an approach of teaching coding
			to children and teenagers in a way that engages girls in particular. I will explain how computer science
			and Python basics that are normally taught as part of introductory computer science classes can be combined
			with creativity, self-expression, and a community in order to create a welcoming environment and an
			intriguing coding experience. I will show how we follow the constructionist and constructivist
			theories in education, in which discovery learning, “building” knowledge, personal exploration,
			and relevant learning are instrumental. I will discuss how at imagiLabs we have developed a
			curriculum around these principles and the findings of our own user-centered research. Finally,
			I will show some of our Creative coding in Python activities in action. Come ready to get creative,
			get inspired, and learn how you can express yourself through code!
