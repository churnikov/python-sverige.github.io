			<b>Abstract: </b>Websockets and webhooks serve like a backbone of a modern real-time API system, providing a way to
			communicate in real-time changes or updates.
			During this talk I’ll introduce what websockets and webhooks are, why and for what they are useful, some of the
			security issues you need to be aware of and how to use Python to write a websocket client/server and a webhook producer/consumer.
			Especially for webhooks I’ll talk about the complexity of creating a reliable system that can scale to hundreds of
			webhooks, of the necessary retry policies you need to support and of the strategies you can put in place
			to alleviate slow or faulty consumers.
