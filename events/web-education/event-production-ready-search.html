			<b>Abstract: </b>One of the common actions we perform, when we visit a website is search. Whether it’s an e-commerce website or video
			streaming platform, search always plays a major role. It takes thousands of hours of engineering efforts
			to get this done. Elasticsearch is one of the famous service built over the Apache Lucene (Open Source
			Search Engine written in Java) and powers up the search in numerous applications. It’s a real-time based
			distributed search system. Python is an excellent language to write a production-ready search engine
			using Elasticsearch in very less time.<br>
			In this talk, I will be talking about how production-ready search engines are developed in less time.
			<br>
			I will be covering use-cases of Python and Elasticsearch working together for indexing, retrieval of
			documents and documents scoring (or boosting). I will also discuss the common problems faced by
			engineers to keep the data sync between the SQL database and Elasticsearch.
