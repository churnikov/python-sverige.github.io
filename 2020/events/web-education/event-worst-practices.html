			<b>Abstract: </b>This talk is about the common Anti-Patterns in Python. Among overwhelming resources to teach best practices
			in Python, it is more scary that there are very few places which will teach you worse practices. There are
			plenty of ways to write bad code. But in Python, one in particular reigns as king.
