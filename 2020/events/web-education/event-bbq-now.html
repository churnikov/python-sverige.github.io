			<b>Abstract: </b>How do you know that you can bbq in Stockholm? In my technical "go-over-the-river" solution,
			I have set up a virtual machine that calls the answering machine of Stockholm's fire department
			every night, records the call, transcribes the text, analyzes it and makes a decision whether
			it is a fire ban or not. All this is saved in a database which can then be accessed from
			the kanjaggrilla.nu website.
