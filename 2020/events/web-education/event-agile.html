			<b>Abstract: </b>Agile practises such as short iterations and reprioritizing continuously empower developers to
			deliver high quality software, but what about the needs of the stakeholders? They need to know
			when their problem is going to be solved. Does agile stand in the way of having a transparent
			and predictable workflow?
