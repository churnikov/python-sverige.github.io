			<b>Abstract: </b>Microservices and serverless are hot topics in web development communities that when combined increase the
			potential for developers to make software faster and to host it much cheaper than traditional virtual
			private servers. This talk aims to present a minimal set of tools to start developing Serverless
			Microservices using Python. With the serverless framework configured for Python, developing a new
			microservice API becomes very easy. The framework provides a set of tools to pack Python dependencies
			and also deploys the required infrastructure to the cloud, enabling infrastructure as code since the
			start of the project. Although the serverless framework is used during this presentation, no other
			Python framework is required, making it as easy as possible to start with plain Python code.

			<b>About the speaker: </b>Nilo Ney Coutinho Menezes is a software architect that loves to program in Python and to design new software to run in the cloud.
			A professional computer programmer since the '90s, he has a BS (Data Processing) and MS (Informatics,
			computer networks) degrees from the Federal Univerisity of Amazonas (Brazil) and an incomplete PhD at
			the University of Mons (Belgium). Nilo wrote a book about Python Programming for Beginners, published in
			Portuguese and Spanish. He tries to participate in the Brazilian Python communities, especially in the
			North region of Brazil (9 states), trying to spread Python in the Amazon area.
