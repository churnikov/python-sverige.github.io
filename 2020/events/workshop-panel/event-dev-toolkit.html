			<b>Abstract: </b>This is a tutorial for beginner developers who know Python but don't know how to write a
			Python project from scratch. In 1,5 hours, you will learn how to manage dependencies and different Python versions, 
			set up a project scaffolding with cookiecutter, add tests and documentation. I will also show you some additional 
			static code analysis tools like formatters and linters that you can use to make sure your project is compatible with PEP8 and PEP257.
