		<p>The battle against the covid-19 pandemic is unfortunately not over, as can be seen by the
			increased resurgence of new cases during the summer 2020 in many countries. Meanwhile,
			pharmaceutical companies are racing to research effective vaccines against the virus.
			As these vaccines might go through accelerated approval procedures, evidence towards
			their safety might be more uncertain than usual. Generally, safety concerns of vaccines
			and, more broadly, medicines, can manifest in unexpected forms, making them harder to be
			recognized, assessed and acted upon in a timely fashion. Therefore, effective post-marketing
			surveillance strategies are of great importance for public health.
		<br>
			As senior data scientist at the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.who-umc.org/">Uppsala Monitoring Centre</a> ,
			Lucie has focused on extracting
			meaningful information about medicine safety from different data sources, including social
			media. Now as Head of Data Science, she leads a team of talented data scientists on a journey
			to advance the science of pharmacovigilance, together with research pharmacists and medical
			doctors, to improve patient safety worldwide in collaboration with WHO.
			In her presentation Lucie will introduce the main challenges in post-marketing surveillance
			and demonstrate her group's recent research developments to answer these challenges.
