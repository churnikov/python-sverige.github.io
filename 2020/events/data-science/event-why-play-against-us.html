			<b>Abstract: </b>Lee Sedol’s five game match with Deep Mind’s AlphaGo ignited
			a renewed interest into the use of AI in gaming. From Kasparov
			to Sedol, from classic Atari games to immersive video games,
			humans have competed (and often been defeated) by computerised
			opponents. This talk will give an overview of how AI is used in
			gaming, the game development ecosystem in Python, how reinforcement
			learning can be used to train AI agents and how, instead of competing
			with AI based agents, we can design gaming experiences where human
			players and AI agents collaborate to complete levels.
