			<b>Abstract: </b>Have you ever wanted to run multiple notebooks in sequential and parallel
			order with one click?  If so, come join our Intro to Elyra - an AI centric
			extension for JupyterLab session to learn how you can get set up and
			running with Elyra! This workshop introduces users how to run data
			science notebooks with Elyra - an AI centric extension for JupyterLab.
			The notebook pipeline downloads a free dataset from Data Asset eXchange,
			then extracts, cleanses and analyzes the data file. The cleaned data file
			is subsequently used to predict certain weather features.
