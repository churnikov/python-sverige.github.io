			<b>Abstract: </b>Writing a decorator to modify the wrapper function inside another decorator,
			so that keyword arguments on the modified decorator show seamlessly on the docs
			and signature of the final, decorated, function. Let's dive into the pure Python
			code which manipulates the function object attributes themselves to get this working.
			Real use case.
