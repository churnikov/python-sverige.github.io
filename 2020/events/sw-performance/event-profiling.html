			<b>Abstract: </b>Occasionally weâ€™ll find that some bit of Python weâ€™ve written doesnâ€™t run as fast as weâ€™d like, yet,
			many aspiring programmers are oftentimes unfamiliar with principled techniques to identify performance
			bottlenecks in their code.
			In this tutorial, I will first describe the Python performance analysis ecosystem with broad strokes,
			and then turn to interactive demonstrations to showcase the most prominent tools of trade on a real
			practical problem.
